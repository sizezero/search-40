# search-40

I needed to write a throwaway script to search the [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)/keyboards/ directory for 40% keyboards. I was going to do this in bash, Python, or groovy but then thought this would be a good opportunity to learn [Ammonite for scala scripting](https://ammonite.io/#Ammonite). It turned out well and I'll probably use Ammonite for future scripts.

The script pruned 1500 or so dirs down to around 200. Took some [notes](candidates.md) on each to find some good keyboards.
