### /home/robert/qmk_firmware_kleemann/keyboards/crbn

Looks a lot like contra.

I can't find the hardware anywhere. I think it was a one time group buy.

### /home/robert/qmk_firmware_kleemann/keyboards/funky40

Two, 2u spacebars. It's kind of interesting. For hardware, guy says to
ping him on Reddit.

### /home/robert/qmk_firmware_kleemann/keyboards/horizon

This one is 2u wider but has a dedicated space in the middle for the
controller. This allows the controller to be soldered directly onto
the PCB. The profile looks very flat but some of that is the switches
and caps. I could put a giant 2u by 2u button in the middle. Lots of
build discussion.

This is a really cool possibility for a board. I like that I can have
the microcontroller above the PCB and reduce the space beneath. I
wonder if the sound/tactile feeling of these caseless boards is always
a thing?

The page has really good hardware details and he even recommends a PCB
manufacturer.

stange optional fifth row. doesn't look exceptional but it's a candidate

### /home/robert/qmk_firmware_kleemann/keyboards/naked48

Very interesting keyboard with an open middle. It may only be
available in Japan. Missing the lower right corner keys is not good
for gaming or mouse shifting but I could probably live with it. Since
everything is in Japanese I'd probably have an easier time with the
horizon. Even if it wasn't for the language, the horizon PCB is much
better documented. There are also only pictures of this one as a low
profile so that could be an issue.

Nice but out of stock.

### /home/robert/qmk_firmware_kleemann/keyboards/planck

It's not much different than what I already have but it would probably
give me a better selection of cases. Both OLKB and Planck EZ use hot
swap switches which makes this a non-starter for me. Controller on the
PCB is a neg as well.

### /home/robert/qmk_firmware_kleemann/keyboards/splitish

very cool with open middle for easily socketed controller

Not as sleek as horizon but in the ballpark. Designed for low profile
so I'd have to make sure I'd want those. He says v1 of the PCB is "far
from perfect" and v2 "exists, but I haven't had it fabricated
though. Should still work." Maybe he's telling a noob like me to stay
away. The board doesn't have the aesthetics of the others.

super cool like plaid. Even better it supports a separate controller
card. It doesn't appear you can buy the PCB.

There are 5x12, 4x12, and other options. It looks like it just uses
legos to lift the PCB. From a technical perspective, if I can get the
PCB, everything looks doable. But do I want a keyboard like this?

## Log

### 2022-02-26

I've been using the keyboard solidly for a month, mostly on the
desktop and less on the writing tablet. There is no doubt that the
feel is worse than my favorite DZ60 but there are so many differences
between the two keyboards that it's not possible to pinpoint the
cause. I've also started to get some neck pain that may or may not be
due to the keyboard. If it's caused by the keyboard it could either be
caused by the more forceful presses needed by the cherry clear
switches or it could be the ergonomics of the 40% that requires my
elbows to be held in tighter. Of course, it could be how I sleep or
something completely unrelated.

I picked up a switch tester. Here's some interesting points.

- Compared with the other switches, the cherry clears and browns feel
  practically identical. I think the problem is that pressing one
  switch in isolation is very differnt than using a whole keyboard of
  switches for an extended period of time. There's only so much I can
  learn from a switch tester.

- Tactiles and linears are difficult to tell the difference between
  unless you press the switch very slowly to feel that bump. It is
  probably only noticable with extended typing.

- I am no longer drawn to any of the clickies. I'm glad that I never
  experimented with greens.

- Zealios are very different with a very strong initial bump but
  smooth afterwards. I don't think I'd like a whole keyboard of these
  but they are interesting and much different than most switches.

- Gateron browns actually have a lighter feel than the cherries. I
  wonder if they are worth giving a try.

- Silents feel mushy. Novelkeys creme is super mushy.

- Kailith box prevents some wobble but not much on this
  keyboard. Maybe it would be more noticeable on an entire keyboard

- I think I definitely want a lighter switch on a 40%. This means red
  over blacks, browns over clears, and blues over greeens.

- The linears are very tempting. I wonder if I should try a red, lubed
  linear. It would be easiest if I could borrow one just in case I
  hate it.

- Gateron yellow feels smoother and has a deeper sound than the red
  but according to the spec, the only difference is 50g actuation vs
  45g. This means the reds should feel smoother.

I've been looking at mods I can do to improve the keyboard and the
easiest is adding tape to the back of the PCB and foam between the PCB
and the back plate. I just did this and did not notice an immediate
sound or vibration difference. I'll keep using it over the next few
days and see if there's a difference. I can probably fit an extra
piece of foam in there if I think it will help.
